# Weather Dashboard

The Weather Dashboard is a responsive web application built with React and Vite that allows users to search for any city and view its current weather conditions and 5-day forecast using the OpenWeather API.

This project demonstrates practical use of React fundamentals including state management, props, conditional rendering, asynchronous data fetching, and component-based design.
